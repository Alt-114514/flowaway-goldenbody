write as less code as possible for features, like i do not mean to write less features associated with it, i meant ABSOLUTELY no defensive codes, NONE. assume everything is working perfectly, and you are writing for a perfect world. write as less code as possible, but still make it work. do not write any defensive code, minimal checks, fallbacks only when needed, retries only when needed, just the bare minimum code to make it work. but you still need to consider some edge cases that might not go right. So assume all arguments given to a system feature type function (not called by external apps or arbitrary code), are perfect.
